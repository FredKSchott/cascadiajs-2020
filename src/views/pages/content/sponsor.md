The most important thing we do as a conference is bring developers together to meet, build relationships and learn from one another. Many of the attendees who come to CascadiaJS do so because they are trying to learn new skills, become better engineers, build their professional network or find a new job. 

For companies that are focused on <span class="sponsor-hiring highlight">hiring</span>, <span class="sponsor-marketing highlight">building developer tools</span> or <span class="sponsor-community highlight">supporting the community</span>, we have sponsorships that can help you achieve your goals.

## What We Do

CascadiaJS was started in 2012 by web developers in the Pacific Northwest to better connect and celebrate the amazing work of communities across the region. Last year we had 560+ developers enjoy talks from 36 amazing speakers who covered everything from JavaScript to the distributed web to building healthy engineering teams.

Here are a few data points on the reach of our conference:

* YouTube: 1200+ subscribers and 8k+ views (last 12 months)
* Twitch: 2190 viewers during the 2019 live stream
* Twitter: 3000+ followers and 45k impressions (last 28 days)
* Expected number of attendees for 2020 = 600
