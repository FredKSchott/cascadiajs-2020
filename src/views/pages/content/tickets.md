## What is included in a ticket?

Each ticket includes the following:

* admission to the conference
* breakfast, lunch and dinner on both days
* social events on both days
* a hoodie 
* a pass to one of several fun activities

## Who got access to Super Early Bird ticket?

CascadiaJS 2019 attendees who filled-out our post-event survey were given the option to purchase a Super Early Bird ticket.

## When will speakers be announced?

We expect to start announcing speakers in early April.

## Why would I buy a ticket without knowing who is going to speak?

We have a very deliberate process for selecting speakers for CascadiaJS and it takes time. We publish a CFP, allow 8 weeks for folks to respond, and then we thoroughly review these submissions.

The purpose of Early Bird pricing is to provide a financial incentive for folks to commit to attending the conference before they know exactly what the programming will be. It's a trade-off that works for some people but not others. You are more than welcome to wait until after speakers are announced and purchase a ticket at Regular pricing.

## Who qualifies for an Indie ticket?

You must be buying this ticket yourself, work at a non-profit or a company with less than 10 people.

## Will there be a Scholarship Program?

Yes! Applications for Diversity Scholarships will open on June 1.
