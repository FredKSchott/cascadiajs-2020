## CascadiaJS Conference (Sep 1-2)

We sell tickets to the CascadiaJS conference in batches. The earlier you buy, the cheaper the tickets are! You qualify for "indie" pricing if you are buying this ticket yourself, work at a non-profit or a company with less than 10 people.

## FAQ

### What is included in a ticket?

Each ticket includes the following:

* admission to the conference
* breakfast, lunch and dinner on both days
* social events on both days
* a hoodie (not included with Late Bird tickets)
* a pass to one of several fun activities

### Who got access to Super Early Bird tickets?

CascadiaJS 2019 attendees who filled-out our post-event survey were given the option to purchase a Super Early Bird ticket.

### When will speakers be announced?

We are currently running our [Call for Presenters](/cfp) which closes on March 20. We expect to start announcing speakers in early April.

### Why would I buy a ticket without knowing who is going to speak?

We have a very deliberate process for selecting speakers for CascadiaJS and it takes time. We publish a CFP, allow 8 weeks for folks to respond, and then we thoroughly review these submissions.

The purpose of Early Bird pricing is to provide a financial incentive for folks to commit to attending the conference before they know exactly what the programming will be. It's a trade-off that works for some people but not others. You are more than welcome to wait until after speakers are announced and purchase a ticket at Regular pricing.

### Will there be a Scholarship Program?

Yes! Applications for Diversity Scholarships will open on June 1.
